# Section 1: Age and Gender-wise Accident Trends
st.subheader("1. Age and Gender-wise Accident Trends")
st.markdown("### Insights")
st.markdown("""
- The 25-35 age group has the highest number of accidents due to risk-taking behavior and frequent travel.
- Males are involved in 85.6% of accidents, reflecting higher exposure and riskier driving habits.
""")
st.markdown("### Recommendations")
st.markdown("""
- Launch targeted safety campaigns for young male drivers, focusing on reducing speeding and reckless behavior.
- Introduce gender-specific safety programs to address male-dominated accident trends, such as stress management workshops and gamified training modules.
""")

# Section 2: Major Causes of Road Accidents
st.subheader("2. Major Causes of Road Accidents")
st.markdown("### Insights")
st.markdown("""
- Over-speeding is the leading cause of accidents, accounting for 638,056 incidents annually.
- Drunken driving and driving on the wrong side are significant contributors to accidents.
- Fatigue and mechanical failures also play critical roles in accidents involving trucks.
""")
st.markdown("### Recommendations")
st.markdown("""
- Enforce stricter speed regulations and penalties for drunk driving.
- Equip trucks with fatigue detection systems and ensure regular maintenance to prevent mechanical failures.
- Use technology like AI dash cams to monitor and alert drivers to unsafe conditions.
""")

# Section 3: Rural vs Urban Accident Analysis
st.subheader("3. Rural vs Urban Accident Analysis")
st.markdown("### Insights")
st.markdown("""
- Rural areas face rising accident rates due to poor infrastructure, lack of emergency response, and insufficient enforcement.
- Urban areas report higher accidents in terms of numbers but lower severity due to better road infrastructure.
""")
st.markdown("### Recommendations")
st.markdown("""
- Urban: Enhance traffic management systems and enforce stricter penalties for rule violations.
- Rural: Implement AI to identify high-risk zones, upgrade road infrastructure, and improve emergency response systems.
""")

# Section 4: Digital Route Risk Assessment for Truck Drivers
st.subheader("4. Digital Route Risk Assessment for Truck Drivers")
st.markdown("### Insights")
st.markdown("""
- Unsafe routes with poor road quality and challenging weather conditions significantly increase accident risks for truck drivers.
""")
st.markdown("### Recommendations")
st.markdown("""
- Introduce AI-based route planning tools that analyze weather, traffic patterns, and historical accident data to suggest safer routes.
- Implement real-time alerts for hazards like road closures or extreme weather.
""")

# Section 5: AI-Powered Truck Safety Systems
st.subheader("5. AI-Powered Truck Safety Systems")
st.markdown("### Insights")
st.markdown("""
- AI systems can effectively detect driver fatigue, distractions, and unsafe behaviors in real time.
""")
st.markdown("### Recommendations")
st.markdown("""
- Equip trucks with AI-powered in-cab monitoring systems to track driver health and alert them during fatigue or distractions.
- Use gamification to incentivize safe driving behaviors, rewarding drivers for adherence to safety protocols.
""")

# Section 6: Road Accident Trends Over the Years
st.subheader("6. Road Accident Trends Over the Years")
st.markdown("### Insights")
