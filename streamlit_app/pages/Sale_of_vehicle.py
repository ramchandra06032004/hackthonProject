- **Sales Decline After 2018â€“2019:** 
  The data reveals a consistent drop in vehicle sales across all categories post-2018â€“2019. Several factors contributed to this trend:
  - **Economic Slowdown:** Decreased purchasing power and reduced consumer demand.
  - **BS-VI Emission Standards:** Transition to new emission standards caused delays in vehicle purchases.
  - **Increased Costs:** Rising prices for vehicles due to higher raw material costs, insurance, and taxes.
  - **Shift in Consumer Preferences:** Urban consumers increasingly favor ride-sharing platforms over personal vehicle ownership.
  - **Policy and Financial Challenges:** The introduction of new GST rates, changes in the Motor Vehicle Act, and liquidity crunches in NBFCs contributed to market uncertainty.

- **Significance of Monitoring Trends:**
  This downturn in vehicle sales is essential for stakeholders (manufacturers, policymakers, investors) to develop strategies and adapt to changing market conditions.
